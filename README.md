**Rarity Borders** Rarity Borders shows the color of the item rarity around the item as a border.  
Works with **any** slot like in as **Boss Checklist** or **Magic Storage**!  

It even has **custom** border support!

Now also finally on Github is this **original** version of **Rarity Borders**!

## Custom border guide
1. Navigate to your **tModLoader** directory (normally at ***"...Documents/Terraria/tModLoader"***)
2. Create a folder called **"customAssets"** if not already there.
3. Add your **.png** files to that folder **!(borders are sorted by name in-game)**
4. Keep in mind that the images have to be **52x52** and a **.png** file!
5. Reload the **Rarity Borders** mod.
6. Choose your custom border through the config.  
![ingame config](/guide/ingame_config.png)
![folder structure](/guide/folderStructure.png)

Here is the basic example for orientation:

If you want to stop using a custom border just set the **"Custom border"** setting in the config to -1.
