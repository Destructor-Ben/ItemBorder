Rarity Borders shows the color of the item rarity around the item as a border.

Calamity rarities should work fine now! (Special rarities with "Calamity Rarities Mod")

Also works with magic storage! (Some slots are bugged, sorry for that)

Boss Checklist should be compatible now too!

Has some configurations for specific types of slots (chests,vanity,...)

Also fixed slots for bank slots, hat rack and mannequin.

Fixed Fargo's tooltip bug.

Thank you guys:
