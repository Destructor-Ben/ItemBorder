Rarity Borders shows the color of the item rarity around the item as a border.

Calamity rarities should work fine now! (Special rarities with "Calamity Rarities Mod")

Also works with magic storage!
Boss Checklist should be compatible now too!

Has some configurations for specific types of slots (chests,vanity,...)

Should finally work fine for any slot (except the mods that have a custom ItemSlot drawing method)!

---Still trying to implement borders for items laying around!

Thank you guys:
