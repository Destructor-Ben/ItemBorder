Rarity Borders shows the color of the item rarity around the item as a border. Works with any slot like in as Boss Checklist or Magic Storage!

Now with custom border support! [url=https://github.com/fl4kez/ItemBorder#readme](Read guide)[/url]

Has some configurations for:
 - types of slots (chests,vanity,...) 
 - types of borders
 - setting items as special to have their background changed

---Still trying to implement borders for items laying around!
